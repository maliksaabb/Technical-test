# Paymerang-test
## @ *Malik Usman*

## Deployed link: 

## Instructions:
As you know, we make payments on behalf of our clients. We like to be able to display the payment details in a clear, concise manner for our employees, who are responsible for ensuring the vendors receive the payments.

Attached is a blob of json data that represents the following: There are multiple vendors ("Payee") who will be paid using payment cards ("Payment"), with the associated invoices attached to each payment ("Remittance").

There is only one requirement - create a webpage that shows each Payee/Payment/Remittance object in a paged interface. Everything else is up to you - overall design, technology used, styling, amount of time spent on the test, etc.

## Summary:
Avoided going in extra to keep it simple and also according to the knowledge that i gained till now. At some points, had a little hard time to figure out on how i wanted it to work but with little help and time it worked.

Also, tried to keep the frontend part simple and to mimic the current Paymerang's brand in some areas. Technologies that were used are HTML, CSS and mainly JavaScript and it took me 10 to 15 hours to complete this project.
